Newly uncovered shipping records and 'israeli' government data show 47 documented shipments of military components from Canadian manufacturers to 'israeli' weapons firms between October 2023 and July 2025. This includes over 421,000 bullets, with one shipment of 175,000 in April 2025. Additionally, three cartridge shipments from a Quebec-based General Dynamics facility were sent just nine days after Canada pledged to block munitions exports. These exports primarily supplied Elbit Systems, 'israel's largest arms manufacturer. Canada continues its systematic deception in a continued breach of domestic and international law, highlighting its role in sustaining the ongoing genocide against the Palestinian people."
